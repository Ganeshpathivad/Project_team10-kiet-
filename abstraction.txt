Goal: To develop a model that can predict the next word in a sequence of text, aiding users in generating coherent sentences.

𝐌𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐝𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐲:

Data Preprocessing: The project begins by preparing the data for the model. This includes tokenizing the text (splitting it into individual words or sub-word units), creating sequences of words, and padding these sequences to ensure they are of uniform length.

Model Building: A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, a type of recurrent neural network, is used to build the predictive model. LSTMs are well-suited for tasks involving sequential data like text, as they can capture long-range dependencies between words.

Training: The LSTM model is trained on a large corpus of text. During training, the model learns the patterns and relationships between words, enabling it to predict the next word in a sequence.

Prediction: Once trained, the model can be used to predict the next word in a given sequence. By feeding the model a sequence of words, it outputs a probability distribution over the vocabulary, indicating the likelihood of each word being the next one.
